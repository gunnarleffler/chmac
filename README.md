## Synopsis

macchanger broke, so I decided to write a quick bash script to do the same thing.

## Usage
`chmac.sh <adapter>`

##Example:
```
chmac.sh -r wlan0  -- this sets the mac address to be random
```

## Motivation


Certain public wifi hotspots track you based on mac address. Sometimes your mac address is transported outside of the subnet you are on. I find this to be a little creepy.


## Installation

just download the file chmac and run it. This program is written in bash.

## TODO

Allow specification of hardware vendors.
